Contributions are welcome, but please note that Kindnet is intentionally minimalist and opinionated. We prioritize features that align with general cloud-native networking needs within the Kubernetes ecosystem.  Features that are niche, overly specific to certain networking setups, or lack a clear connection to the Kubernetes project's goals are unlikely to be accepted.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)
for this purpose.
