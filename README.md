# Simple Kubernetes Networking Plugin with IPv4, IPv6 and DualStack support

The main goal of the project is to have a simple Kubernetes Networking Plugin plugin for Kubernetes with
IPv4 and IPv6 support that provides the [Cluster
Networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/)

The idea was born because of the lack of IPv6 support in current CNI plugins
and because there are no automatic alternatives to create a multinode kubernetes
cluster with IPv6.

Kindnet evolved adding new features, as an embedded ipmasq agent and nowadays,
is the default CNI plugin for [KIND](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)

All the original code was moved to the KIND project in-tree.
This repo is kept for new features development and for using it on "real" clusters.


## Kindnet components

It uses the following [standard CNI
plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins)

* `ptp`: creates a veth pair and adds the host and the container to it.
* `host-local`: maintains a local database of allocated IPs. It uses the
  `ipRanges` capability to provide dynamic configuration for the Pods subnets.
* `portmap`: An iptables-based portmapping plugin. Maps ports from the host's
  address space to the container.

And a daemon named `kindnetd` with the following features:

* `CNI config`: configures the CNI plugin dropping the file `/etc/cni/net.d/10-kindnet.conflist`
* `routing`: install routes on the to the POD subnets in the other nodes
* `ip-masq`: non masquerade traffic that is directed to PODs 

## Installation

Kindnet can be installed on your cluster using the manifest [install-kindnet.yaml](install-kindnet.yaml)

`kubectl create -f
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aojea/kindnet/master/install-kindnet.yaml`


Kindnet installation manifest has an init container that drop the CNI binaries in the folder `/opt/cni/bin/`, however, you can install them directly supressing the init container in the manifest and
following the next steps:

```sh
export ARCH="amd64"
export CNI_VERSION="v1.1.1"
export CNI_TARBALL="${CNI_VERSION}/cni-plugins-linux-${ARCH}-${CNI_VERSION}.tgz"
export CNI_URL="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/${CNI_TARBALL}"
curl -sSL --retry 5 --output /tmp/cni.tgz "${CNI_URL}"
mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
tar -C /opt/cni/bin -xzf /tmp/cni.tgz
rm -rf /tmp/cni.tgz
```
