While CNI provides a general framework for container networking, its full feature set isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary for Kubernetes environments. This presents an opportunity for optimization.
At its core, Kubernetes has two primary networking requirements for CNI:
IP Address Management (IPAM): Assign IP addresses to Pods. Interface Configuration: Create and configure network interfaces within Pods. Many CNI plugins, however, are designed for more complex scenarios beyond Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; needs.</description></item><item><title>Kindnet</title><link>https://aojea.github.io/kindnet/docs/design/kindnet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2024 22:54:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aojea.github.io/kindnet/docs/design/kindnet/</guid><description>Kindnet is a simple yet powerful Kubernetes Network Plugin designed for performance, scalability, and low resource consumption. It provides essential networking capabilities for Kubernetes Pods, including IP address management (IPAM), network policy enforcement, DNS caching, NAT64, and more.
Architecture Kindnet follows a node-centric architecture, with a dedicated agent running on each Kubernetes node. This agent is responsible for:
Pod Networking: Creating and configuring network interfaces for Pods. IPAM: Allocating and managing IP addresses for Pods.</description></item></channel></rss>
